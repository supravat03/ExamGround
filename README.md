# ExamGround

ExamGround is a web-based application for technical evaluation. During this pandemic it has become difficult for students to be physically present to give exams and for the institute as well to conduct exams while following all pandemic-rules. There comes the need to change the way most of the exams are conducted. It becomes easier for professors to efficiently evaluate the students thoroughly through a fully automated system that not only saves a lot of time, efforts but also gives fast results.

Features: 
1) Display questions randomly.​
2) As soon as a student starts the exam, a timer will start so that student can keep an eye on the remaining time.​
3) A Notice-Board where faculty can send information which can be accessed by the students.​
4) The faculty can keep track of the results of appeared students in a test and everyone can also see their results.​
5) The objective answers will be checked automatically by the system from the database. Subjective answers can be checked manually and can be further updated by the faculty. ​
6) Students can give feedback to faculty as well the subject. ​
7) Students can see how much marks they got in every question. ​
8) Online Result declaration.
